## About The Project

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator that helps you ship beautiful, accessible docs. For building our [documentation](https://docs.dyte.io) portal, we have made certain modifications over the template generated by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to be able to properly showcase all our SDKs with their respective versions.

We are delighted to see our documentation featured on [Docusaurus Site Showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase), and hope you like it!
