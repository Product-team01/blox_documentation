### Introduction

Vue provides the ability to upload and utilize datasets in your workflows. Document processing workflows often generate large datasets that are challenging to track. Vue also enables the analysis and profiling of datasets directly on the platform, for both existing and newly uploaded/generated ones. You can generate and create reports to view metrics and visualizations, obtaining the information you need in a quick and readable manner.

### Navigation

From the Vue Home Page, hover over Data Hub’s Document Manager and click on ‘Datasets’ on the navigation bar to access the Dataset Listing.

### Dataset Listing

Here, you can upload new datasets and manage all existing datasets as needed.

#### Upload

- Click the ‘+ Upload Dataset’ button on the Dataset Listing Screen and provide a Dataset Name.
- Drag and drop your file onto the dropbox or click the ‘Browse’ button to select from your device.
- Click the ‘Upload’ button to finish.

#### Dataset Statuses

- **Profiled**: Indicates the dataset has been ‘Profiled’ and additional metadata is now available for analysis.
- **Profiling In Progress**: Indicates the dataset is currently being profiled, which may take a few minutes depending on the dataset size.
- **Not Profiled**: Indicates the dataset has not been profiled.

#### Search

Search for datasets using the Dataset name via the search bar or use one of the suggested/recently searched keywords. Results are displayed in the table.

#### Sort Columns

Hover over a column header to find the sort icon and click it to sort the column alphabetically in either ascending or descending order. The last applied sort takes precedence.

#### Filter Columns

Hover over a column header to find the filter icon and click it to open a dropdown for multi-select filtering. Results are displayed in the table.

#### Delete Dataset

Click the Delete icon next to a Dataset name to prompt a confirmation modal. Deleting a dataset removes it and its content permanently.

### Datasets - Analyze & Visualize

Click on a Dataset Name or the edit icon to view and manage that dataset.

#### Profile Data

Click the Profile Data icon to begin data profiling. Once profiled, enriched metadata is available for improved data management.

#### Use in Workflow

Click ‘Use in Workflow’ to be directed to the workflow canvas with the dataset pre-selected.

#### Dataset Overview

Add/edit basic details like Name, Description, and tags. View basic metadata such as Total Records, Total Size in Memory, and Data type Distribution.

#### Schema Details

Navigate to the Schema details tab to view each field of the dataset and related metadata, including memory, count of distinct values, mean, min, max, etc., if profiled.

#### Sample Data

View a sample of records in the ‘Sample Data’ tab and resample as needed.

#### Reports

Navigate to the ‘Reports’ tab to view or create custom reports. Use the ‘+ New Reports’ button to start building a report by adding visualizations, configuring them, and applying filters. Save to view your custom visualization on the Dashboard.

Add as many visualizations as needed or use “Generate Reports” for AI-driven custom reports. Resize visualization cards and use quick formatting tools for presentation. Expand to view in full screen or export your report as a PDF.
