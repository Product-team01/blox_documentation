### Document Type Statuses

- **Registered**: Once you have successfully created and registered a Document Type, its status will reflect as "Registered." This indicates that the associated extraction workflow has been registered and is ready for use.
- **Draft**: A Draft status indicates that the Document Type has not yet been registered and will not be listed for use. To register, simply click on edit, resume configurations, and click the Register button when you're ready.

### Search
